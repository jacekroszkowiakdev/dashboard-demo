# Prisma Dashboard Project

A full-stack project to explore advanced Prisma queries and realistic data modeling using a modern TypeScript stack.

---

## Project Overview

This is a simulated dashboard for managing users and posts, built using:

- Node.js + TypeScript for a strongly typed backend
- Prisma ORM for database access, migrations, and type-safe queries
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Faker for seeding realistic fake data
- React + TypeScript frontend to render data in a UI table

The goal is to practice advanced Prisma querying, including filtering, aggregation, computed fields, and data modeling — all backed by a robust and scalable stack.

---

## Technologies and Why They Were Chosen

### Backend: Node.js + TypeScript

- Node.js: Lightweight and efficient server runtime
- TypeScript: Provides static typing and IDE support, critical for working with Prisma's generated types

### ORM: Prisma

- Prisma ORM handles:
  - Database migrations and schema versioning
  - Type-safe queries using auto-generated TypeScript clients
  - Easy relation mapping (`include`, `select`, nested `where`)
  - Advanced filters and aggregations
- Eliminates the need to write raw SQL for 95% of tasks

### Database: PostgreSQL

- PostgreSQL is a production-grade relational database
- Excellent support in Prisma
- Enables:
  - Full-text search
  - JSON fields (`JSONB`)
  - Rich data types and indexing
  - Strong concurrency model
- Scales better than SQLite and is cloud-ready (e.g., Render, Supabase, Neon)

### Data Seeding: Faker

- `@faker-js/faker` is used to populate the database with realistic users and posts
- Essential for:
  - Testing filters, pagination, and sorting
  - Creating dynamic dashboards and reports
  - Simulating real-world scenarios

### Frontend: React + TypeScript

- React is the industry standard for modern frontend applications
- TypeScript ensures UI and data integration are robust
- Data is fetched from the API and rendered in a dynamic table with real-time statistics

## Learning Objectives

- Use advanced Prisma queries:
  - `include`, `select`, `where`, `aggregate`, `groupBy`
  - Filtering nested relations (e.g., posts with more than 100 views)
- Understand relational modeling and seeding with realistic data
- Learn how to structure a full-stack TypeScript application
- Build UI components that reflect real backend logic

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/prisma-fake-dashboard.git
cd prisma-fake-dashboard
npm install
```

### 2. Setup PostgreSQL

Run PostgreSQL locally or with Docker:

```bash
docker run --name pg-prisma -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

Create a database and set your `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/prisma_dashboard"
```

### 3. Run Prisma Migrations and Seed

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Start Backend Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Setup and Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What's Next

- Add pagination and sorting in frontend
- Build filters and advanced query params (`?views_gt=500`)
- Add user roles and permissions
- Deploy to Vercel + Render/Supabase
- Use Prisma's middleware for logging or access control

---

## Real-World Use Cases Simulated

- Dashboards for CMS/admin panels
- Analytics and engagement metrics
- Multi-tenant user management
- Backend APIs for mobile/web clients
